Two Wheel Nav Notes:

-	The style and layout of the site will completely change. I am interested
	in implementing a boot strap theme.

-	The search page will most likely be taken out. All search functions
	will be implemented on the home page. Reduce the need for guest users
	to navigate and simplifies the site map.

-	Once logged in and viewing the profile page there will be information on
	saved routes and possibly saved POI's. This has not been layed out in the site
	yet because I'm not sure how the information will be delivered from the google
	API.

-	The homes pages has no content yet because I intend to display API related
	content on this page and I have not yet written any code to make the connection
	to the API. The home page will include information on POI's and possibly local
	businesses. This depends on what the google maps API offers.

-	With Regards to CRUD. I decided not to add a delete account function. data is
	valuable so I will backup and store all user data.
