Two Wheel Nav Notes:

-	The search page will most likely be taken out. All search functions
	will be implemented on the home page. Reduce the need for guest users
	to navigate and simplifies the site map.

-	Once logged in and viewing the profile page there will be information on
	saved routes and possibly saved POI's.

-	The google maps api will be implemented over the 7-8 of October 2017. Once
  completed I will commit the changes to git hub.
