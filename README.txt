TWO WHEEL NAV:

Two wheel nav is a navigational website aimed at motorcyclists. Two Wheel Nav implements the Google Maps api and allows users to create, plan and save routes. Two Wheel Nav is designed to help motorcylsits plan their travel routes destinsations prior to hitting the road. Two Wheel Nav will also help promote businesses by displaying local business information that is in the vicinity of a motorcyclists planned route.

Two Wheel Nav Notes:

The search page will most likely be taken out. All search functions will be implemented on the home page. Reduce the need for guest users to navigate and simplifies the site map.

Once logged in and viewing the profile page there will be information on saved routes and possibly saved POI's.

The google maps api will be implemented over the 7-8 of October 2017. Once completed I will commit the changes to git hub.
